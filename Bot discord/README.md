# Discord bot
Projects did for my High School years with the goal of develop a music bot in javascript for a Discord server

## Music bot
> Simple music bot with a full-blown queue system

## Install

```bash
npm i
```
## Usage

Edit the config.js file to connected the bot with Google and discord thanks to an API. Then selected a prefix to give the bot's instructions:

```js
exports.TOKEN = ''; // Your token here

exports.PREFIX = 'm!'; // Your preferred prefix here

exports.GOOGLE_API_KEY = ''; // Your youtube/google API key here
```
